    "Does the call contain a timing objection? \n",
    "To provide clarity, a 'timing objection' refers to a scenario where the Prospect expresses interest in the product and is open to discussing its utilization within their company at a future date. However, they indicate that the current moment is not opportune for making purchasing decisions. This may be due to a variety of time-related factors such as the end of a financial quarter, the onboarding of new employees, ongoing layoffs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of phrases that might indicate timing objections:\n",
    "\"Now is not the right time\"\n",
    "\"Next quarter might be a better time to circle back\"\n",
    "\"Right now our focus is on this, but that might change in the future\"\n",
    "\"No way that we're buying anything this year, but next year maybe\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that a 'timing objection' does not refer to instances where the Prospect indicates that it is simply a bad time for them to engage in the phone call itself. \n",
    "It specifically pertains to situations where there are external, time-bound factors affecting the Prospect’s ability or willingness to proceed with a purchasing decision.\n",
    "Furthermore, a 'timing objection' is not applicable if the Prospect categorically refuses to consider the product for reasons that are likely to be permanent or long-term, such as an established strategy, commitment to a competitor, size of the company (too small), or budgetary constraints.\n",
    "To reiterate, if the prospect says they are currently using a competitor but seem open to talking after the competitor's contract runs out, that does NOT count as a timing objection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objections can only be said by prospects, so if the sales rep mentions something time-related, that should not be counted as an objection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give your response in YAML format. The response should have the following fields:\n",
    "reason - A string value that explains your reasoning for the answer.\n",
    "monologueIndex - An integer value pointing to the first index of the monologue in the call transcript that justifies the answer to the question. Only provide this field if the answer was true.\n",
    "answer - A boolean value of true or false. True indicates that the answer to the question was \"yes\". False indicates that the answer to the question was \"no\".\n",
